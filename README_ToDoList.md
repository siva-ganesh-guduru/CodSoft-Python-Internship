The To-Do List application is a simple command-line tool built using Python that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. The application allows users to create, view, and update their to-do list.

Features of the To-Do List Application:

View tasks: When the application is run, the user can choose to view their existing tasks. If there are tasks in the list, they will be displayed with their current status (whether they are completed or not). If there are no tasks, the application will inform the user that the list is empty.

Add task: The user can add new tasks to the to-do list. When prompted, the user can enter a description of the task they want to add. The application then appends the new task to the existing list in a text file named tasks.txt. Each task is stored on a new line in the file.

Update task status: Users can update the status of a task to indicate that it has been completed. When the user chooses this option, the application will display the current list of tasks with their indexes. The user can then enter the index number of the task they want to mark as completed. The application will update the task in the tasks.txt file by appending [Done] to the task description to indicate completion.

How to use the To-Do List Application:

Clone the repository: The user needs to clone the GitHub repository containing the To-Do List application code to their local machine using Git.

Run the application: The user navigates to the project's root folder in the command-line/terminal and runs the Python script todo_app.py. This will start the application, and the user will see a command menu with options to interact with the To-Do List.

Interact with the application: The user can choose from the available options in the command menu. They can view existing tasks, add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, or exit the application.

Contribution: The README.md file also mentions that contributions to the project are welcome. Users can open issues for bug reports or feature requests and submit pull requests to enhance the application.
